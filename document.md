In this file I will document my successes/failures and general updates about the code.

I played around a bit with sockets and server/client functionality. Have not included a loop so the converstation goes on forever nor have I made any actual functionality but played around
with sending data back and forth between the server and the client! Time spent 1h 30 min

Made a bit of functionality this was more to get used to fully using sending and recieving data from client and server. Overall I think I got how it works even if I do quite a bit of errors
before succeding. Time spent another 1 hour.

Made it so factorial is calculated but it needs some more revision in terms of error handaling.
